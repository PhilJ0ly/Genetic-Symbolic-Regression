# Genetic-Symbolic-Regression
## A ground up implementation of a genetic programming approach to symbolic regression

This serves as a complete implementation and illustration of a simple symbolic regression (SR)algorithm based on the genetic programming (GP) like mutations, crossovers, and natural selection. The notebook relies on the [**PySR**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01582) library by Miles Cranmer and the [symbolic-regression-python](https://github.com/datarobot-community/symbolic-regression-python/tree/master) repository from *datarobot-community*.
